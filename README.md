## 🌟 Key Features

### Interactive Flow Designer

🎨 The interactive flow designer is a user-friendly visual interface that enables users to design intricate conversation flows for their chatbots. Users can drag and drop nodes to create branching paths, define user inputs, and specify responses at each step. This feature allows businesses to craft personalized and dynamic conversations that guide users through various scenarios.

### Automated Responses

⚙️ Automated responses eliminate the need for manual intervention by providing instant replies to common user queries. Businesses can pre-define responses for frequently asked questions, greetings, and more. For instance, when a user asks about business hours, the chatbot can instantly provide accurate information, enhancing user satisfaction and saving time for both customers and businesses.

### API Integration

🔗 API integration empowers chatbots to fetch real-time information from external sources and present it to users within the conversation. For example, an e-commerce chatbot could use API integration to retrieve product details, prices, and availability directly from the business's database. This real-time functionality enhances user experience and provides up-to-date information.
